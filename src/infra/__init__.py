"""Infrastructure Layer.

This package contains the implementation details for interacting with external systems and
resources, such as databases, message queues, external APIs, and file systems.
It provides the necessary adapters and bridges to connect the domain layer with the outside
world, adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle.

Key responsibilities:

* Data persistence: Implement repositories and data access objects to store and retrieve domain
 entities.
* External communication: Integrate with external services and APIs using appropriate clients and
 adapters.
* File handling: Manage file operations, such as reading, writing, and processing files.
* Other infrastructure concerns: Handle any other technical details required for the application
 to function, such as logging, monitoring, and configuration management.
