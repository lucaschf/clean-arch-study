"""Application Layer.

This package defines the use cases and application services that orchestrate the interactions
 between the domain layer and the infrastructure layer. It acts as a bridge between the user
 interface or external systems and the core domain logic.

Key responsibilities:

* Use case implementation:
  Define the specific actions and workflows that fulfill user requests or system requirements.
* Application services: Provide additional coordination and orchestration logic across multiple
 domain objects or use cases.
* Input validation: Ensure that incoming data is valid and conforms to the expected format.
* Output formatting: Prepare data for presentation to the user or external systems.
* Transaction management: Manage the consistency and integrity of data across multiple operations.

The application layer plays a crucial role in translating user intentions into domain actions and
 ensuring that the system responds appropriately. It encapsulates the application-specific logic,
 leaving the domain layer focused on pure business rules and the infrastructure layer focused on
 technical implementation details.
